Software engineering is a process of creating systemic computer programs using engineering principles and methodologies with tools to develop and maintain high quality solutions for specific user needs.
Software engineering is highly important because it helps in digitization and automation of business processes thereby enabling efficiency and speed in service delivery.
The relevance of software engineering is visible in the following areas;
Finance: Financial technology has revolutionized banking.Mobile and Internet banking has helped improved access and spread of banking service outside the physical banking structures.
Entertainment and Communication: Virtual reality, podcast, live streaming, social media tools,etc has made communication fast and interesting.
Healthcare: Telemedicine with online diagnosis and consultation has taken medical services far and wide to a large number of people through mobile apps and web based services.

3 critical Milestones in the Evolution of software engineering are;
Development of programming languages: Programming languages have evolved through the evolution of software engineering from basic programming, Fortran, to JavaScript, C++, Python programming,etc. These has aided code design and development which is critical to software engineering.
Promp Engineering: The task of software programming is highly technical and intensive, prompt engineering helps a developer to craft solutions specifically and concisely to meet the needs requirements of the projects. This aid the pace of software program development.
Robotics and Artificial intelligence: Software engineering has evolved significantly, machines can be programmed to assist human in routine task that are repetitive. Robots and chatbox are programmed to attend to task to help human focus on more pressing needs. This saves time and helps productivity.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): This entails the integration of critical tasks towards production of high quality software systems which gives best service to users.

Phases in Software development life cycle;
Requirements: This entails problem definition where the needs of the project is assessed and documented in line with system requirements.
Design: This entails the development of high level detailed architectural framework for the software systems.
Implementation: This entails code development according to design specification.
Testing: Software products must be tested to ensure it meets quality standard and functionality.
Deployment: After the quality assurance is confirmed, software product is deployed to create solutions for users.
Maintenance: This helps to keep the software optimal and updated to cater for changes and new developments.

Waterfall and Agile are software development methodologies which are critical tools in project development.
Obviously, waterfall methodology follows a sequential downward pattern stage by stage process, while agile methodology follows an iterative pattern which is flexible and more collaborative in software development.
Waterfall model can be used in Customer relationship management system.
Agile on the other hand is suitable for projects with high level of uncertainty, like currency trading systems or betting and gaming systems.

Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
