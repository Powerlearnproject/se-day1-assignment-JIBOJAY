Software engineering is a process of creating systemic computer programs using engineering principles and methodologies with tools to develop and maintain high quality solutions for specific user needs.
Software engineering is highly important because it helps in digitization and automation of business processes thereby enabling efficiency and speed in service delivery.
The relevance of software engineering is visible in the following areas;
Finance: Financial technology has revolutionized banking.Mobile and Internet banking has helped improved access and spread of banking service outside the physical banking structures.
Entertainment and Communication: Virtual reality, podcast, live streaming, social media tools,etc has made communication fast and interesting.
Healthcare: Telemedicine with online diagnosis and consultation has taken medical services far and wide to a large number of people through mobile apps and web based services.

3 critical Milestones in the Evolution of software engineering are;
In less than a century of software engineering, beginning from the 1950's through the millennium, programming engineers have creatively contribute to 
Development of programming languages. Programming languages have evolved through the evolution of software engineering from basic programming, Fortran, to JavaScript, C++, Python programming,etc. These has aided code design and development which is critical to software engineering.
Institutionalization of software engineering as an educational field of study: This has contributed to extensive innovation in programming. Methodology and design of software applications have been transformed to respond to changes in a flexible and scalable manner as the needs arise using agile models.
Robotics and Artificial intelligence: Software engineering has evolved significantly, machines can be programmed to assist human in routine task that are repetitive. Robots and chatbox are programmed to attend to task to help human focus on more pressing needs. This saves time and helps productivity.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): This entails the integration of critical tasks towards production of high quality software systems which gives best service to users.

Phases in Software development life cycle;
Requirements: This entails problem definition where the needs of the project is assessed and documented in line with system requirements.
Design: This entails the development of high level detailed architectural framework for the software systems.
Implementation: This entails code development according to design specification.
Testing: Software products must be tested to ensure it meets quality standard and functionality.
Deployment: After the quality assurance is confirmed, software product is deployed to create solutions for users.
Maintenance: This helps to keep the software optimal and updated to cater for changes and new developments.

Waterfall and Agile are software development methodologies which are critical tools in project development.
Obviously, waterfall methodology follows a sequential downward pattern stage by stage process, while agile methodology follows an iterative pattern which is flexible and more collaborative in software development.
Waterfall model can be used in Customer relationship management system.
Agile on the other hand is suitable for projects with high level of uncertainty, like currency trading systems or betting and gaming systems.
Role and responsibilities of a Software developer: A software developer usually called a devops engineer is responsible for code design, he creatively writes code to create solutions based on the needs requirements and implements software solutions according to systems specification of the project.
A quality assurance engineer is responsible for smooth running of software solutions ensuring efficiency and optimality.
A project manager oversees the planning, management and seemless execution of all stages of the software development life cycle ensuring projects are delivered timely on budget.

Integrated Development Environment (IDEs) can be described as a work station where programs are developed from writing codes, to debugging, testing of codes and optimization. Typically Visual studio code works perfectly as an IDE tool which aid software solutions.
Version control systems helps developers to streamline their programs by monitoring changes to source code and coordinating works among team members.
Git is an important tool of Version control systems.

Software development entails  coordination and collaboration of tasks among a team of engineers with specific responsibilities, a high level of team spirit is necessary for timely project delivery.Members must be flexible and open minded to respond to changes which may be warranted by new development in the requirements. Poor design of architecture might derail optimality which would affect effective solution from the software. 
Timing and deadlines on project might pressure engineers into easy solutions which would be vulnerable to unstable circumstances.
Agile methodology with clear communication and understanding of task, roles and responsibilities of team members would improve the end result of the project.

Testing is strictly a specialty of the quality assurance engineer, it is highly important for software solution's reliability.

Testing can be done in the following ways;
Unit testing; this refers to testing individual component part of a software solution.
Integrated testing: it entails testing interactions between or among different components in a software solution.
System testing: this helps to run the whole software solution checking the smooth running and systems efficiency in solving the problem of interest.
Acceptance testing is to affirm the user satisfaction of the program. A good software solution must align with user requirements.

Promp Engineering:
This is a process of crafting concise and clear questions to a machine in order to get best possible responses which produces efficient result in decision making.
prompt engineering helps human to get the best services out of an Artificial Intelligent machine or Robot.

Vague prompt are unspecified open prompt which gives no scope to the Artificial intelligence machine.
Example of a vague prompt is;
"who is the best player in the world"
This prompt would return large uncoordinated responses that would not give clear possible result to the user.

A more concise and clear prompt should be:
"who is the best football player in the world"

"who is the best basketball player in the world"
football and basketball has given a context to the prompt thereby limiting the scope of possible responces from the machine.
